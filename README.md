  <p>When I am older I want to be an athletic director for a high school either nack in Iowa or in Colorado. I enjoy watching and being around sports and helping to elevate young kids in athletics.</p>
  <p>My friend Xavier likes to eat spaghetti very loudly and my other roomate Jimmy does not like when people eat loudly near him. They had a solid arugement for about 15 minutes.</p>
